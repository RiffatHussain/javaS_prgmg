/* Further Adventures
 *
 * 1) Add a call to showMovieInfo and run the program.
 *    What happens?
 *
 * 2) Declare a movie variable
 *    but don't assign it a value.
 *    Run the program. What happens now?
 *
 * 3) Create an empty object and
 *    assign it to the movie variable.
 *    Run the program again.
 *    Does the output change?
 *
 * 4) Add title, actors and directors properties
 *    to the movie object. Run one more time.
 *    Is the output as expected?
